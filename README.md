# Nexus Project

This project has grown exponentially more ambitious than ever before.

All of my ideas, converging into one.

`py` currently contains [the Stable Chaos]() model, and the [Tranception()]() engine.
`go` is evolved from the QFdb 'forest hypergraph' solution, which can sit at the core of the Nexus Network Protocol.. it's the potential to be some storage. It's a filesystem manager, if you will. an indexer/hasher
