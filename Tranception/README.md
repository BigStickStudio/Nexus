### Overview
The Tranception Evokation System is designed to simulate and manage cognitive processes through the manipulation of oscillatory phases (theta), frequencies (omega), and resolutions. This system leverages transceivers (reflectors) to receive, process, and transmit information, enhancing communication and interaction within the network.

The system is scientifically significant due to its ability to precisely calculate and manipulate oscillatory phases (theta), frequencies (omega), and resolutions. These capabilities are crucial for optimizing signal processing and understanding cognitive dynamics.

The question is, can we use this to represent different models of physical existence, cognition, or for procedural generative and machine learning purposes?

### Usage

 - The `Tranception` model can be ran with `python main.py`, and simply outputs single timestep values from a given set of inputs. This diagram is far from complete.

### Todos:
 - [ ] implement a dynamic ability to define theta externally
 - [ ] stabilize and scale the transceiver model to ensure functional integrity
 - [ ] integrate a particle like system to represent data tranception between nodes
 - [ ] implement unit tests
