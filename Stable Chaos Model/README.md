# Stable Chaos Model

## Objective 
Prove that a 'quantum' or 'abstract' super state can exist as a 'transient' abstract state.

The concept is that something could maintain a stateful and stateless form in a sort of superposition between possible states, representing all states simultaneously.

## Description
The HATS Stable Chaos Model is built on top of a construct of a relationship between it's neighbors and it's oppositions.

The rules are simple. A single node in the system will try to maintain attribution towards one of it's neighbors, and the inverse towards it's opposing neighbor, while attempting to maintain an opposing movement to it's own opposite. That means all nodes have a potential to have 2 degrees of freedom of +/-1, meaning that each node has a superposition of A | B | !A | !B in this model.

This model can be scaled multi-dimensionally, and also could be given a level of intensity for each degree of freedom as well. We are using flat colors to represent a given state, but lerping could be implemented, as could be a 4th dimension in the color spectrum representing intensity or volume. I couldn't figure out a good way to represent -volume or void'ness being a simple mapping of -1 to black and +1 to white, but there is still much room for this model to be expanded, and to grow in dimensionality.

Interestingly it is it's own inversion or opposition that creates stability in the system, and it's own likeness to it's neighbors, or relative associations, that introduces a constant state of chaos.

Some stability can be witnessed, as a likeness to it's parts has opposition within itself, which is what also creates a constant state of chaos.

This program is a proof showing that both chaos and stability are rooted in one another, and how this dynamic system can be used as a foundational building block for an infinite number of quantum states. 

This system has between 6,000 and 300,000 potential states, depending on if you could 4^9 or 9^4 (regarding positions and potential states), and can also be converted from binary to floating point values to create a literal infinite system.

Slow down the program to 10fps if you wish to watch changes in real time.. and even though, I consider this a proprietary system, I encourage anyone to take this code, design pattern, or philosophy and make it their own.

## Run Example
`python main.py`
