# HATS - Hybrid Abstract Transitory State
(unstable, in development)

### Intent 
An attempt to create a highly scalable abstract type that can have infinite transitory states, and self-defining relationships.

### Description
The core of this system has multiple components, but a single function.
 - Tranception:
    To naturally define rules that allow for a given set of nodes to transmit and receive, at scale, across an infinitely scalable system of resonators reflecting back at one another.

    (credit to EatThePath for the simple yet powerful observation)
    One degree of freedom â€” a single axis and a range of values.  That axis is independent from other observables. 
    
    This degree of Freedom is 2-dimensional but can be intrinsically observed as Theta presently defined as atan2(sin, cos). Our angles are derived from the threshold which trails the resonance, which allows for cyclic observance over any delta.

### Usage:
 - The `Stable Chaos Model` can be ran with `python main.py`, and signifies a network of 4 nodes attempting to follow and oppose itself.
 - The `Tranception` model can be ran with `python main.py`, and simply outputs single timestep values from a given set of inputs. This diagram is far from complete.
