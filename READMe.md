# HATS - Hybrid Abstract Transitory State

An attempt to create a highly scalable abstract type that can have infinite transitory states.

The core of this system has multiple components, but a single function.
 - Tranception:
    To naturally define rules that allow for a given set of nodes to transmit and receive, at scale, across an infinitely scalable system of resonators reflecting back at one another.

    (credit to EatThePath for the simple yet powerful observation)
    One degree of freedom â€” a single axis and a range of values.  That axis is independent from other observables. 
    
    This degree of Freedom is 2-dimensional but can be intrinsically observed as Theta presently defined as atan2(sin, cos). Our angles are derived from the threshold which trails the resonance, which allows for cyclic observance over any delta.
