# HATS - Hybrid Abstract Transitory State
(unstable, in development)
 Tranception is a model that defines rules that allow for infinite scalability based on first principals.. Defining concepts like resonance, threshold induction, interference and divergence. This allows for the emergence of self-awareness, and can be used to represent any model of anything that can be defined by a wave, or as having some flow, and could even be used for concepts like convolutions, neural networks, and basically anything that could be represented as having some geometry, volume, or fluctuation over time.

 The Stable Chaos Model defines how a system can have an infinite number of states, be self-guiding, self-actuation, and self-stabilizing. It is a system for defining the relationship between stable systems and chaotic systems.

### Description
The core of this system has multiple components, but a single function.
 - Tranception:
    To naturally define rules that allow for a given set of nodes to transmit and receive, at scale, across an infinitely scalable system of resonators reflecting back at one another.

    (credit to EatThePath for the simple yet powerful observation)
    One degree of freedom â€” a single axis and a range of values.  That axis is independent from other observables. 
    
    This degree of Freedom is 2-dimensional but can be intrinsically observed as Theta presently defined as atan2(sin, cos). Our angles are derived from the threshold which trails the resonance, which allows for cyclic observance over any delta.

### Usage:
 - The `Stable Chaos Model` can be ran with `python main.py`, and signifies a network of 4 nodes attempting to follow and oppose itself.
 - The `Tranception` model can be ran with `python main.py`, and simply outputs single timestep values from a given set of inputs. This diagram is far from complete.
